# CodeCaster.SerializeThis

## Building and Running

This project is a Visual Studio Extension, so you'll need to install the [Visual Studio SDK](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt683786.aspx) in order to compile it. 

If you want to run the project, set the CodeCaster.SerializeThis as startup project, and in the project's Properties, on the Debug tab, set "Start external program" to Visual Studio ("C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\Common7\IDE\devenv.exe" for Visual Studio 2015) and set the Command line arguments to `/rootSuffix Exp`, so the Experimental Instance will be started.
